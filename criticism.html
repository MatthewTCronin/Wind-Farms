  <h1>Criticism</h1>
  
  <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>

<p>Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor.[114] Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months.[114]
Onshore wind farms are criticised for their impact on the landscape. Their network of turbines, roads, transmission lines and substations can result in "energy sprawl".[115] Typically they need to take up more land than other power stations and are more spread out.[116] To power many major cities by wind alone would require building wind farms bigger than the cities themselves.[117] Typically they also need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to "industrialization of the countryside"[118] and habitat loss.[115] A report by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland concluded that wind farms have a negative impact on tourism in areas known for natural landscapes and panoramic views.[119] However, land between the turbines can still be used for agriculture.[120]
Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are the greatest impact of wind farms on wildlife.[115] There are also reports of higher bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may[121] or may not be significant,[122] depending on specific circumstances. The estimated number of bird deaths caused by wind turbines in the United States is between 140,000 and 328,000, whereas deaths caused by domestic cats in the United States are estimated to be between 1.3 and 4.0 billion birds each year and over 100 million birds are killed in the United States each year by impact with windows.[122] Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of peat bogs, affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.[123]</p>  
  
  <h2>Human Health</h2>
  <img src="images/nathan-mcbride-mokWXKenVoY-unsplash.jpg" alt="human health" width="568" height="350"> 
  
<p>There have been multiple scientific, peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise, which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' causing Vibroacoustic disease, although some suggest further research might still be useful.[124][125]
A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond about 800 metres (0.5 miles). Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans.[citation needed] There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans.[126]
In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighboring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbor) as a precautionary approach.[127]
A 2014 paper suggests that the 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' is mainly caused by the nocebo effect and other psychological mechanisms.[122][128] Australian science magazine Cosmos states that although the symptoms are real for those who suffer from the condition, doctors need to first eliminate known causes (such as pre-existing cancers or thyroid disease) before reaching definitive conclusions with the caveat that new technologies often bring new, previously unknown health risks.[129]</p>  
  
  <h2>Effect on Power Grid</h2>
  
<p>Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line.[130]
The intermittent nature of wind power can pose complications for maintaining a stable power grid when wind farms provide a large percentage of electricity in any one region.[131]</p>  

  <h2>Ground Radar Interference</h2>
  
<p>Wind farms can interfere with ground radar systems used for military, weather and air traffic control. The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern.[132] Actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected, as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that. But aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task.[133][134] The US military is using wind turbines on some bases, including Barstow near the radar test facility.[135][136]</p>

  <h2>Effects</h2>
  <img src="images/john-mcarthur-6vXTBjJG1ak-unsplash.jpg" alt="effects" width="568" height="350"> 
  
<p>The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning.[137] Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration.[138] Radar issues have stalled as much as 10,000 MW of projects in USA.[139]
  Some very long range radars are not affected by wind farms.[140]</p>

  <h2>Mitigation</h2>
  
<p>Permanent problem solving include a non-initiation window to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm, and a similar method mitigates the false returns.[141] England's Newcastle Airport is using a short-term mitigation; to "blank" the turbines on the radar map with a software patch.[142] Wind turbine blades using stealth technology are being developed to mitigate radar reflection problems for aviation.[143][144][145][146] As well as stealth windfarms, the future development of infill radar systems could filter out the turbine interference.
A mobile radar system, the Lockheed Martin TPS-77, can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines, and more than 170 TPS-77 radars are in use around the world.[147]</p>

  <h2>Radio Reception Interference</h2>
<p>There are also reports of negative effects on radio and television reception in wind farm communities. Potential solutions include predictive interference modelling as a component of site selection.[148][149][150]
Wind turbines can often cause terrestrial television interference when the direct path between television transmitter and receiver is blocked by terrain. Interference effects become significant when the reflected signal from the turbine blades approaches the strength of the direct unreflected signal. Reflected signals from the turbine blades can cause loss of picture, pixellation and disrupted sound. There is a common misunderstanding that digital TV signals will not be affected by turbines — in practice they are.</p>

  <h2>Agriculture</h2>

<p>A 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades.[151]
In another study an analysis carried out on corn and soybean crops in the central areas of the United States noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts, and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves. Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5–3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades, can make a difference for the cultivation of corn.[152]</p>
