  <h2>Experimental and Proposed</h2>
  
  <p>Experimental wind farms consisting of a single wind turbine for testing purposes have been built. One such installation is Ã˜sterild Wind Turbine Test Field.
  Airborne wind farms have been envisaged. Such wind farms are a group of airborne wind energy systems located close to each other connected to the grid at the same point.[62]
  Wind farms consisting of diverse wind turbines have been proposed in order to efficiently use wider ranges of wind speeds. Such wind farms are proposed to be projected under two criteria: maximization of the energy produced by the farm and minimization of its costs.[63]</p>
