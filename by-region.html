<h3>China</h3>
  <img src="/MatthewTCronin/Wind-Farms/blob/main/images/luo-lei-Xa4pTwafe5U-unsplash.jpg?raw=true" alt="luo-lei-Xa4pTwafe5U-unsplash.jpg" width="568" height="350"> 

<p>In just five years, China leapfrogged the rest of the world in wind energy production, going from 2,599 MW of capacity in 2006 to 62,733 MW at the end of 2011.[67][68][69] However, the rapid growth outpaced China's infrastructure and new construction slowed significantly in 2012.[70] At the end of 2009, wind 
power in China accounted for 25.1 gigawatts (GW) of electricity generating capacity,[71] and China has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country's economy.[72] With its large land mass and long coastline, China has exceptional wind resources.[73] Researchers from Harvard and Tsinghua 
University have found that China could meet all of their electricity demands from wind power by 2030.[74] By the end of 2008, at least 15 Chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components.[75] Turbine sizes of 1.5 MW to 3 MW became common. Leading wind 
power companies in China were Goldwind, Dongfang Electric, and Sinovel[76] along with most major foreign wind turbine manufacturers.[77] China also increased production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines (80 MW) in 2008. Through all these developments, the Chinese wind industry appeared 
unaffected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008, according to industry observers.[76] According to the Global Wind Energy Council, the development of wind energy in China, in terms of scale and rhythm, is absolutely unparalleled in the world. The National People's Congress permanent committee passed a law that 
requires the Chinese energy companies to purchase all the electricity produced by the renewable energy sector.[78]</p>

<h3>Europe</h3>
  <img src="/MatthewTCronin/Wind-Farms/blob/main/images/peter-franken-nntAXxs4SO0-unsplash.jpg?raw=true" alt="peter-franken-nntAXxs4SO0-unsplash.jpg" width="601" height="300">

<p>In 2011 the European Union had a total installed wind capacity of 93,957 MW. Germany had the third-largest capacity in the world (after China and the United States), with an installed capacity of 
29,060 MW at the end of 2011. Spain had 21,674 MW, and Italy and France each had between 6,000 and 7,000 MW.[79][80] By January 2014, the UK installed capacity was 10,495 MW.[81] But energy production can be different from capacity – in 2010, Spain had the highest European wind power production with 43 TWh 
compared to Germany's 35 TWh.[82] Europe's largest windfarm is the 'London Array', an off-shore wind farm in the Thames Estuary in the United Kingdom, with a current capacity of 630 MW (the world's largest off-shore wind farm). Other large wind farms in Europe include Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm near Constanța, 
Romania with 600 MW capacity,[83][84] and Whitelee Wind Farm near Glasgow, Scotland which has a total capacity of 539 MW. An important limiting factor of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity 
of dispatchable generation capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a "supergrid" to connect national grids together[85] across western Europe, ranging from Denmark across the southern North Sea to England and the Celtic Sea to Ireland, and 
further south to France and Spain especially in Higueruela which was for some time the biggest wind farm in the world.[86] The idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from Denmark to the Baltic Sea the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not 
blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere.</p>

<h3>India</h3>

<p>India has the fifth largest installed wind power capacity in the world.[87] As of 31 March 2014, the installed capacity of wind power was 21136.3 MW mainly spread across Tamil Nadu state (7253 MW).[88][89] Wind power accounts nearly 8.5% of 
India's total installed power generation capacity, and it generates 1.6% of the country's power.</p> 

<h3>Japan</h3>

<h3>Jordan</h3>

<p>The 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm in Jordan was inaugurated in December 2015, and is the first large scale wind farm project in the region.[90]</p>

<h3>Morocco</h3>

<p>Morocco has undertaken a vast wind energy program, to support the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the country. The Moroccan Integrated Wind Energy Project, spanning over a period of 10 years with a total investment estimated at $3.25 billion, will enable the country to bring the installed 
capacity, from wind energy, from 280 MW in 2010 to 2000 MW in 2020.[91][92]</p>

<h3>Pakistan</h3>

<p>Pakistan has wind corridors in Jhimpir, Gharo and Keti Bundar in Sindh province and is currently developing wind power plants in Jhimpir and Mirpur Sakro (District Thatta). The government of Pakistan decided to develop wind power energy 
sources due to problems supplying energy to the southern coastal regions of Sindh and Balochistan. The Zorlu Energy Putin Power Plant is the first wind power plant in Pakistan. The wind farm is being developed in Jhimpir, by Zorlu Energy Pakistan the local subsidiary of a Turkish company. The total cost of project 
is $136 million.[3] Completed in 2012, it has a total capacity of around 56MW. Fauji Fertilizer Company Energy Limited, has build a 49.5 MW wind Energy Farm at Jhimpir. Contract of supply of mechanical design was awarded to Nordex and Descon Engineering Limited. Nordex a German wind turbine manufacturer. In the 
end of 2011 49.6 MW will be completed. Pakistani Govt. also has issued LOI of 100 MW Wind power plant to FFCEL. Pakistani Govt. has plans to achieve electric power up to 2500 MW by the end of 2015 from wind energy to bring down energy shortage. Currently four wind farms are operational (Fauji Fertilizer 49.5 MW 
(subsidiary of Fauji Foundation), Three Gorges 49.5 MW, Zorlu Energy Pakistan 56 MW, Sapphire Wind Power Co Ltd 52.6 MW) and six are under construction phase ( Master Wind Energy Ltd 52.6 MW, Sachal Energy Development Ltd 49.5 MW, Yunus Energy Ltd 49.5 MW, Gul Energy 49.5 MW, Metro Energy 49.5 MW, Tapal Energy ) 
and expected to achieve COD in 2017. In Gharo wind corridor, two wind farms (Foundation Energy 1 & II each 49.5 MW) are operational while two wind farms Tenaga Generasi Ltd 49.5 MW and HydroChina Dawood Power Pvt Ltd 49.5 are under construction and expected to achieve COD in 2017. According to a USAID report, 
Pakistan has the potential of producing 150,000 megawatts of wind energy, of which only the Sindh corridor can produce 40,000 megawatts.</p>

<h3>Philippines</h3>
  <img src="/MatthewTCronin/Wind-Farms/blob/main/images/reegan-fraser--Z0iPtOWUn8-unsplash.jpg?raw=true" alt="reegan-fraser--Z0iPtOWUn8-unsplash.jpg" width="456" height="365">

<p>The Philippines has the first windfarm in Southeast Asia. Located Northern part of the countries' biggest island Luzon, alongside the seashore of Bangui, Ilocos Norte. The wind farm uses 20 units of 70-metre (230 ft) high Vestas V82 1.65 MW wind turbines, arranged on a single row stretching along a nine-kilometer 
shoreline off Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea. Phase I of the NorthWind power project in Bangui Bay consists of 15 wind turbines, each capable of producing electricity up to a maximum capacity of 1.65 MW, for a total of 24.75 MW. The 15 on-shore turbines are spaced 326 metres (1,070 ft) apart, each 70 
metres (230 ft) high, with 41 metres (135 ft) long blades, with a rotor diameter of 82 metres (269 ft) and a wind swept area of 5,281 square metres (56,840 sq ft). Phase II was completed in August 2008, and added 5 more wind turbines with the same capacity, and brought the total capacity to 33 MW. All 20 turbines 
describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea. Adjacent municipalities of Burgos and Pagudpud followed with 50 and 27 wind turbines with a capacity of 3 MW each for a Total of 150 MW and 81 MW respectively. Two other wind farms were built outside of Ilocos Norte, the 
Pililla Wind Farm in Rizal and the Mindoro Wind Farm near Puerto Galera in Oriental Mindoro.</p>

<h3>Sri Lanka</h3>

<p>Sri Lanka has received funding from the Asian Development Bank amounting to $300 million to invest in renewable energies. From this funding as well as $80 million from the Sri Lankan Government and $60 million from France's Agence Française de Développement, Sri Lanka is building two 100MW wind farms from 2017 
due to be completed by late 2020 in Northern Sri Lanka.[93] As of September 2015 a number of sizable wind farms have been constructed in South Africa mostly in the Western Cape region. These include the 100 MW Sere Wind Farm and the 138 MW Gouda Wind Facility. Most future wind farms in South Africa are earmarked for 
locations along the Eastern Cape coastline.[94][95][96] Eskom has constructed one small scale prototype windfarm at Klipheuwel in the Western Cape and another demonstrator site is near Darling with phase 1 completed. The first commercial wind farm, Coega Wind Farm in Port Elisabeth, was developed by the Belgian 
company Electrawinds.</p>

<p>U.S. wind power installed capacity in September 2019 exceeded 100,125 MW and supplies 6.94% of the nation's electricity.[106] The majority of wind farms in the United States are located in the Central Plains, with slow expansion into other regions of the country. 
New installations place the U.S. on a trajectory to generate 20% of the nation's electricity by 2030 from wind energy.[107] Growth in 2008 channeled some $17 billion into the economy, positioning wind power as one of the leading sources of new power generation in 
the country, along with natural gas. Wind projects completed in 2008 accounted for about 42% of the entire new power-producing capacity added in the U.S. during the year.[108] Texas, with 27,036 MW of capacity, has the most installed wind power capacity of any U.S. 
state, followed by Iowa with 8,965 MW and Oklahoma with 8,072 MW.[106] Iowa is the leading state in terms of wind energy accounting for nearly 40% of total energy production in 2019. The Alta Wind Energy Center (1,020 MW) in California is the nation's largest wind 
farm in terms of capacity. Altamont Pass Wind Farm is the largest wind farm in the U.S. in terms of the number of individual turbines.[109] At the end of 2019, about 114,000 people were employed in the U.S. wind industry,[110] and GE Energy was the largest domestic 
wind turbine manufacturer.[111] Wind projects boost local tax bases and revitalise the economies of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land, with some farmers selling their wind royalties.[112][111] In 2018, 
US wind power provided enough electricity to power approximately 25 million homes, avoiding the emissions of 200 million tons of carbon.[113][108]</p>
