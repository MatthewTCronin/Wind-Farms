  <h2>Design and Location</h2>

<p>The location is critical to the success of a wind farm. Conditions contributing to a successful wind farm location include: wind conditions, access to electric transmission, physical access, and local electricity prices. The faster the average wind speed, the more 
electricity the wind turbine will generate, so faster winds are generally economically better for wind farm developments. The balancing factor is that strong gusts and high turbulence require stronger more expensive turbines, otherwise they risk damage. The average power 
in the wind is not proportional to the average wind speed, however. For this reason, the ideal wind conditions would be strong but consistent winds with low turbulence coming from a single direction. Mountain passes are ideal locations for wind farms under these conditions. 
Mountain passes channel wind blocked by mountains through a tunnel like pass towards areas of lower pressure and flatter land.[7] Passes used for wind farms like the San Gorgonio Pass and Altamont Pass are known for their abundant wind resource capacity and capability for 
large-scale wind farms. These types of passes were the first places in the 1980s to have heavily invested large-scale wind farms after approval for wind energy development by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. From these wind farms, developers learned a lot about turbulence 
and crowding effects of large-scale wind projects previously unresearched in the U.S. due to the lack of operational wind farms large enough to conduct these types of studies on.[8] Usually sites are screened on the basis of a wind atlas, and validated with on-site wind 
measurements via long term or permanent meteorological-tower data using anemometers and wind vanes. Meteorological wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is 
crucial to determining site potential[9][10] in order to finance the project.[11] Local winds are often monitored for a year or more, detailed wind maps are constructed, along with rigorous grid capability studies conducted, before any wind generators are installed The wind 
blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings. However, at higher altitudes, 
the power in the wind decreases proportional to the decrease in air density. Rendering significantly less efficient power extraction by the wind turbines, requiring for a higher investment for the same generation capacity at lower altitudes.[12] How closely to space the 
turbines together is a major factor in wind farm design. The closer the turbines are together the more the upwind turbines block wind from their rear neighbors (wake effect). However spacing turbines far apart increases the costs of roads and cables, and raises the amount of 
land needed to install a specific capacity of turbines. As a result of these factors, turbine spacing varies by site. Generally speaking manufacturers require 3.5 times the rotor diameter of the turbine between turbines as a minimum. Closer spacing is possible depending on 
the turbine model, the conditions at the site, and how the site will be operated.[citation needed] Airflows slow down as they approach an obstacle, known as the 'blockage effect', reducing available wind power by 2% for the turbines in front of other turbines.[13][14] Often 
in heavily saturated energy markets, the first step in site selection for large-scale wind projects before wind resource data collection is finding areas with adequate Available Transfer Capability (ATC). ATC is the measure of the remaining capacity in a transmission system 
available for further integration of generation without significant upgrades to transmission lines and substations, which have substantial costs, potentially undermining the viability of a project within that area, regardless of wind resource availability.[15] Once a list of 
capable areas is constructed, the list is refined based on long term wind measurements, among other environmental or technical limiting factors such as proximity to load and land procurement. Many Independent System Operators (ISO's) in the United States such as the California 
ISO and Midcontinent ISO use interconnection request queues to allow developers to propose new generation for a specific given area and grid interconnection.[16] These request queues have both deposit costs at the time of request and ongoing costs for the studies the ISO will 
make for up to years after the request was submitted to ascertain the viability of the interconnection due to factors such as ATC.[17] Larger corporations who can afford to bid the most queues will most likely have market power as to which sites with the most resource and 
opportunity get to be developed upon. After the deadline to request a place in the queue has passed, many firms will withdraw their requests after gauging the competition in order to make back some of the deposit for each request that is determined too risky in comparison to 
other larger firmsâ€™ requests.</p>
